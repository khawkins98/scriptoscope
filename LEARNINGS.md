# Learnings

A running log of things we've learned building Aaron UI — gotchas, dead ends, surprises, and decisions worth remembering. The goal is to save the next person (or future-you) from rediscovering the same lessons.

This file is intentionally empty at project start. Entries are added bottom-up as the project ships, with dated headers and enough narrative to be useful in six months without context. The companion file in [classic-vibe-mac/LEARNINGS.md](https://github.com/khawkins98/classic-vibe-mac/blob/main/LEARNINGS.md) is worth reading for the convention.

## Pre-implementation context (read first)

The handful of decisions below were made before any Aaron UI code was written. They're recorded here so that anyone picking up Phase 1 doesn't have to reverse-engineer the reasoning from the upstream ticket trail.

### 2026-05-16 — why Aaron UI exists at all (the extraction decision)

cv-mac built Mac OS 8 Platinum chrome on top of [WinBox](https://nextapps-de.github.io/winbox/) over several months. The chrome got closer and closer to the real thing but hit a structural ceiling: roughly 70% of the remaining authenticity gap was within reach via cv-mac's own CSS (the work tracked in [classic-vibe-mac #229](https://github.com/khawkins98/classic-vibe-mac/issues/229)), another ~15% via a thin shell layer ([classic-vibe-mac #215](https://github.com/khawkins98/classic-vibe-mac/issues/215) Phase 2), but ~30% was structural to WinBox itself.

The specific structural items:

- **Integrated scrollbar gutter.** Platinum scrollbars share a gutter with the window frame. WinBox puts scrollbars *inside* `.wb-body`; the grow handle is a separate `.wb-se` overlay. We can fake the look, never the geometry.
- **Status bar at window bottom.** Platinum windows had an optional thin status strip. WinBox has no such slot; we'd have to fake it inside body content with no integration into the frame.
- **Title-bar windowshade arrow.** Mac OS 8 had a visible arrow on the right of the title bar to collapse the window. WinBox doesn't expose a slot for it.
- **Mac-instant drag with pattern flicker.** WinBox drag has web-style acceleration and renders the pinstripe as a static background-image during drag. Different feel entirely.

The AI-agent shift was the second factor. In 2019, replacing a window manager was a multi-week project — expensive enough that the answer was always "live with the library you have." In 2026, with AI assistance, the WM core sizes out at ~600-800 LOC of TypeScript and a 1-2 day project, plus a week of edge-case polish over the following months. That's a different calculus.

The themes angle was the third. Once we were owning the WM anyway, building it around an Appearance-Manager-style *theme engine* (rather than baking in Platinum) turned the project from "a Platinum CSS library" into "a faithful reproduction of how Mac OS appearance actually worked." Apple's Mac OS 8.5 shipped themes as first-class loadable bundles (chrome + controls + desktop + sounds); third-party Kaleidoscope did the same on 7.x/8.x earlier. None of that exists on the web.

**Application:** when picking up Phase 1, design the WM around the eventual theme engine — even though Phase 4 is the engine itself, Phase 1's data structures should leave the seam clean. Don't bake the Platinum look into the WM core.

### 2026-05-16 — naming (Aaron UI, after considering nine others)

The name comes from Apple's internal codename for the Copland-era demo that previewed both the Appearance Manager and the Platinum default theme. The `UI` suffix sits in the established `[Name] UI` family (Material UI, Chakra UI, Shadcn UI) and is self-describing for newcomers who don't know the Aaron reference.

Alternatives considered and rejected (full trail in [classic-vibe-mac #246](https://github.com/khawkins98/classic-vibe-mac/issues/246)):

- *Aaron* alone — unsearchable.
- *AaronKit* — period-coherent (UIKit/AppKit lineage) but assumes the reader knows the Aaron reference; hides the "UI library" signal.
- *AaronJS* — generic.
- *Mac-Aaron* — Apple trademark exposure.
- *Aaron Web UI* — "Web" redundant next to "UI".
- *Appearance / AppearanceJS* — technically clearest but unsearchable.
- *Copland* — failed-Apple-project baggage.
- *PlatinumKit / Charcoal* — tie too tightly to one theme; mismatched scope for a theme engine.
- *Kaleidoscope* — collides with the modern git diff tool.

**Application:** if anyone proposes renaming during early development, this entry is the rationale. The decision was load-bearing on the project's positioning (drop-in UI library for the retro/period niche), not aesthetic preference.

### 2026-05-16 — license deliberately left open

The temptation is to match the upstream cv-mac / wasm-retro-cc family (GPL-3.0-or-later). The honest reason to defer: this is a library *meant to be embedded in other projects*, and the right license depends on a question we can't yet answer — how much do we want it used by closed-source projects?

- MIT / Apache-2.0 maximizes adoption.
- LGPL is the classic library-license compromise (copyleft on the library, not on consumers who dynamically link).
- GPL-3.0-or-later matches family and is honest if we value share-back.

The decision is deferred until after Phase 1 ships and we have a sense of who's actually picking it up. Until then `package.json` says `UNLICENSED` and the README is explicit that the project is pre-license.

**Application:** do not pick a license on someone's reflexive "all repos should have a LICENSE" instinct. The deferral is deliberate. Open an issue to discuss before merging any LICENSE file.
